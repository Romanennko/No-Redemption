# No-Redemption
No Redemption is a tense arcade game with a side view where there are no winners, only your skill and ability to last as long as possible. You find yourself in a confined room filled with deadly traps that won't give you a moment's peace.

With each passing moment, the difficulty increases: the traps get faster and there are more of them. The goal is simple, but not easy to achieve: live as long as possible, avoiding imminent death. Don't wait for rescue or escape - there is only you and chaos that cannot be stopped.
